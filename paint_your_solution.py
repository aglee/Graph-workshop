# Skeleton code for participant solutions to the paint splash problem presented
# in workshop. To run the tests for this problem, run the paint_tests.py script

def paint_splash( pixels, click_point, target_color ):
    # Inputs:
    # pixels: [ [ int ] ]
    # click_point: ( int, int )
    # target_color: int

    # YOUR CODE HERE. Modify pixels in place. Or create a new array, I don't care.
    # In place is better practice though.

    return pixels
